          <p>
            Live escape room games are fast becoming the most popular activities in major centres around the world. [<a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Attractions-g255106-Activities-c56-Auckland_North_Island.html">Auckland</a>,

            The concept is simple: you are locked in a room where you must solve a series of puzzles to escape within a given time limit.
          </p>

          <h3>Container:</h3>
          <p>
            Shipping containers are easy to transport, compact, and secure.
            The Locked Room has been built into a shipping container to promote ease of transport to wherever the new owner wishes to base this pop-up business.
            The container features:
            <ul>
              <li>Full insulation</li>
              <li>Air conditioning</li>
              <li>Built in ranch-slider (behind main container doors)</li>
              <li>Front office</li>
              <li>Lined walls, floor and ceiling</li>
            </ul>
            Once inside it is easy to forget you are inside a shipping container as the rooms are well lit with LED lighting and the walls are lined with tongue &amp; groove style panels.
            A fire extinguisher has been installed and the container has a current electrical warrant of fitness.
            Photos of the inside show little of the room so we don&rsquo;t give too much away; if you&rsquo;re interested - we&rsquo;d rather show you through in person.
          </p>

          <h3>The Room:</h3>
          <p>
            Themed around a 1950&rsquo;s Cold War Bunker, the room contains an authentic Morse code machine, Bakelite telephones, and a telephone exchange.
            The exit door is surrounded with LED lights that change colour from red to green as the players complete the room, triggered by sensors placed within various puzzles.
            The sequence of puzzles has been carefully planned and tweaked to ensure the players have plenty to do inside the room, but not too much that they cannot finish in the allocated time of 60 minutes.
            Getting this right takes a lot of trial-and-error, which we have taken care of over during a three month trial period.
            Everyone we&rsquo;ve put through the room absolutely loved it - as can be seen by the feedback on <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Attraction_Review-g255113-d9728199-Reviews-The_Locked_Room-Taupo_Taupo_District_Waikato_Region_North_Island.html
            ">TripAdvisor</a>.
            Tourists with experience at other locked rooms consistently comment on the high quality of this particular room.
          </p>

          <h3>Marketing:</h3>
          <p>
            The logo and website are exclusively yours, this is not a franchise!
            Click <a href="/mockup.html">this link</a> to see a mock-up of what the website looks like when the business is operational.
            You will receive high-quality vector based graphics that can be used for your marketing material.
            We have found that the majority of people find the business through the <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Attraction_Review-g255113-d9728199-Reviews-The_Locked_Room-Taupo_Taupo_District_Waikato_Region_North_Island.html">TripAdvisor page</a>, which will be transferred to the new owners.
            It has 11 excellent reviews and became the fourth most popular listing under "Activities &amp; Games" in Taupo in just three months!

            Competition in the escape room industry is beneficial as players will often seek out other escape rooms to try, sometimes traveling the country in search of new rooms.
            Take this opportunity to get into the live escape room market with this fully functional, plug-and-play business.
          </p>

          <h3>The Business:</h3>
          <p>
            The online booking system integrated into the website allows you to set your own hours easily.
            Going away for a weekend? Set those days as busy (from anywhere in the country) to prevent customers from booking a room on those days - it couldn&rsquo;t be simpler.
            We&rsquo;ve trialled the business for three months to check everything works as expected.
            With an average group size of 2.6 people, the business takes $82 per session. Running only three sessions each day yields $1722 in revenue per week, with plenty of room to grow.
            Fixed operating costs are <a id="popoverCosts" class="lead" href="#" style="font-size: 21px" data-content="
        $21.85 p/month for the online booking system,
        $7.23 p/month for a Google Business account including email,
        $21.50 p/year for domain name http://thelockedroom.co.nz,
        $21.50 p/year for domain name http://lockedroom.co.nz, and
        $99.00 p/year for web hosting
              " rel="popover" data-placement="bottom" data-original-title="Breakdown of costs - $9.45 p/week" data-trigger="hover">
              less than $10 per week</a> - excluding site costs &amp; power.
          </p>

          <h3>The Package:</h3>
            <span style="font-size: 1.4em">$40 000 + GST</span> includes:
            <ul>
              <li>the container, including all puzzles, and the office (including computer)</li>
              <li>all branding assets, website, Facebook and TripAdvisor accounts</li>
              <li>assistance creating new brochures and website alterations</li>

          <!-- <p class="lead">
            The Locked Room is a real-life escape-room game built into a 20&#39; shipping container.
            The container is fully insulated, air conditioned, and is divided into two rooms: the &#39;escape&#39; room and a front office.
            The front office is complete with ranch-slider, computer desk (with computer), and seating for clients.
            The room&rsquo;s theme is &quot;cold war espionage&quot; and is furnished with authentic items relevant to the post war era.
            Items such as real Bakelite telephones, morse-code machines, and telephone exchanges have had their internals reworked with appropriate electronics so as to be functional elements of the room.
            Sophisticated, behind the scenes, electronics are a major feature of this room providing feedback to both the players in the room and the operator in real-time.
            A unique puzzle stream (the sequence and specific interaction of puzzles that lead players to their end-goal) has been designed and fully tested to ensure trouble free operation.
            This game is currently pitched at a medium to difficult level but can be easily altered to create an easier game experience.
            The room is designed for three to four players, but can easily accommodate between two and five.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            Currently, the game is located in Taupo, but is designed to be easily relocatable with no permanent fixtures necessary.
            Shipping containers are easy to move as well as being robust and able to be securely locked when not in use.
            The Locked Room comes with <a href="http://thelockedroom.co.nz">its own website</a>, including an integrated booking management system, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The-Locked-Room-901044863324449">Facebook page</a> and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Attraction_Review-g255113-d9728199-Reviews-The_Locked_Room-Taupo_Taupo_District_Waikato_Region_North_Island.html">TripAdvisor listing</a> - complete with all 100% positive reviews from our testing period.

          <p class="lead">
            Live Escape-room games are fast becoming the top thing to do in many cities around the world – often number one on Trip Advisor activity lists.
            For example, escape room games fill the top three spots on TripAdvisor under <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.nz/Attractions-g255106-Activities-Auckland_North_Island.html">Fun Activities and Games in Auckalnd</a>.
          </p>
          <p class="lead">
            These live games, evolved from online or virtual escape games, and involve players being locked in a room, using elements in the room to solve puzzles, find clues, and escape.
            The game rooms usually have a theme and are carefully planned and constructed to appear 'normal' - but which hide many devious and cunning puzzles.
